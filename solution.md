# Technical choice:

## Reasons for choosing Vue 3 for this project:

- It is claimed by the Vue team that Vue 3 is faster and lighter than Vue 2. But for now I can not really see the difference.
- Typescript support.

## Reasons for choosing Vite:

- It is a part of Vue ecosystem, made by the same guy who made Vue.
- It is very fast as people said.

## Reasons for choosing TailwindCSS:

- Very easy to integrate
- Fasten my development speed by alot

## Reason for using local storage:

> I find that it's a good user experience when they accidentally close the tab they can come back later and be able to continue where they left off.

### Q: What if people manually change local storage value which will bypass the client-side logics/validators?

> In real practice, there should be both client-side Javascript function validator and server side protection to avoid this from successfully submit.
> <br>
> However, since this is a small project test, I fire a small Javascript logics protection on page load (page mount) to make sure if anything goes wrong, we will prevent them from advancing.
